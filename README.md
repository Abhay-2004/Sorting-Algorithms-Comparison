# Sorting-Algorithms-Comparison
This project implements and compares four sorting algorithms (Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort) for sorting 2D integer points in a coordinate plane. The main goal is to find the median coordinate point by sorting the input points separately by their x and y coordinates.
